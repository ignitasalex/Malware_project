# EternalBlue Ransomware Project

## Overview

The idea of this project is to attack a small-medium company that runs several Windows machines. First, we will send an email to an employee saying that his company has been selected to test our new financial tool that is powered by machine learning and AI. This tool consists of an Excel tool containing a malware macro. 

When the employee downloads the file and habilitates the content, it will download some files from our public server, then it will do a scan of all possible Eternal Blue vulnerable machines that are in the same subnet as the victim. If it finds vulnerable machines, it will try to attack them by sending the exploit script and running it.
