# EternalBlue Ransomware Project

This is a project, part of the Malware course of the Cybersecurity Master at UPC.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to compromise a small to medium-sized enterprise that operates several Windows-based systems. Initially, an email will be dispatched to an employee, informing them that their company has been chosen to test a new financial tool enhanced by machine learning and artificial intelligence. This purported tool is an Excel file embedded with a malicious macro.

Upon the employee downloading the file and enabling its content, the macro will initiate the download of additional files from our public server. Subsequently, it will conduct a scan of all machines within the same subnet as the initial target, specifically identifying those susceptible to the EternalBlue vulnerability. If vulnerable machines are detected, the macro will attempt to exploit them by deploying and executing the exploit script.


### Scenario

![Malware_project](documents/scenario.PNG)

On the left side, we observe the victim company's environment, which includes the computer designated to receive the email containing the malware, as well as other vulnerable machines within the same network. On the right side, we see the attacker's setup, comprising a Kali machine used for debugging purposes and a server responsible for the downloading and uploading of files.

### Phases of attack

This attack comprises five distinct phases (the last of which is optional) designed to infiltrate the victim's environment, perform basic reconnaissance to identify vulnerable elements, and subsequently exploit them. These phases are as follows:

- Phishing
- Environment Scanning
- EternalBlue Exploitation
- Ransomware Encryption
- Ransomware Decryption [Optional]
